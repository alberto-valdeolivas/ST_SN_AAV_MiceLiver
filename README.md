## Abstract

Gene therapy using recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors holds great promise, but how serotype, sex, and liver zonation influence transduction and transcriptomic changes is not fully understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilized Visium spatial transcriptomics combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing to map the spatial distribution and transcriptomic impacts of rAAV2- and rAAV9-CMV-EGFP vectors in male and female mouse livers. Spatial transcriptomics enabled precise transgene mapping, showing rAAV2's periportal and rAAV9's pericentral preferential transduction, with higher transduction in males. We identified deregulation of lipid metabolism genes (Elovl3, Chka, Irs2, Ppard), independent of zonation, serotype, and sex, while Srebf1, Tlcd4, Cpt2, and Acot1 exhibited sex-specific patterns. Circadian clock modulators (Dbp, Tef, Arntl, Nfil3, Nr1d1/Nr1d2) were altered in a zonation-independent manner. Immune and stress-response genes, including Gadd45g, showed sex-specific regulation. The study also highlighted upregulation of TGF-Î² and EGFR pathways, and downregulation of hypoxia pathways in females. Moreover, we identified known and potential novel rAAV entry factors such as Rpsa, Dpp4, Sdc1, and solute carrier family proteins. These findings offer insights into rAAV vector effects on liver biology and highlight spatial transcriptomics as a powerful tool for mapping transduction and tissue responses, advancing gene therapy research.
